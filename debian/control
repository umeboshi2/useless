Description: base package for python-useless packages
 This package contains modules that are used by other python-useless packages.
 In this package are modules for handling config files, and modules for small
 generic functions that can be used elsewhere, but have nowhere else to go.

Description:  Database access package
 This package is useful for accessing sql databases with a higher level
 wrapper than the standard db2.0 python cursors.  Postgres is currently the
 only database that is supported, although there is limited support for sqlite
 databases.

Description: simple gtk gui widgets
 This package contains pygtk widgets.  Some widgets are subclassed 
 from the standard pygtk widgets, while others are composites of multiple 
 gtk widgets that are classed to work like one big widget.  The goal was 
 to decrease the amount of writing for commonly used widgets that are 
 used in various applications.  This package will fall out of maintenence 
 and be deprecated one day in favor of the kde/qt widgets.  I have found 
 that the kde/qt widgets decrease the amount of wrapping/subclassing that 
 I have had to use to keep the codebase short and simple.

Description: sql statement helper
 This package is designed to make it easier to form sql statements by 
 making python objects.  The modules in this package range from being 
 simple to very complex, though not that complex yet.  There is support 
 for generating plpgsql functions, though its still limited and simple.  There 
 is no requirement to use the more complex parts of the package, but 
 there are times when doing so will make the development easier.  The 
 simple statement classes should be very portable to other databases, 
 but the more complex ones are more geared towards postgres.  The 
 python-pgsql dependency is only there because the quote function is 
 used from it.  A pure python replacement function would be required to 
 drop that dependency.

Description: useless kde widgets
 these are simple modules for simple application development.  This
 code is young, and probably really useless.

Description: useless kde database widgets
 these are some very simple hacky db widgets for pykde.  if you are
 interested in this, you can probably find something better somewhere
 else.
